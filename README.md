## Project Description
The Advanced Model Trainer and Evaluator is a Python project aimed at demonstrating advanced machine learning techniques with scikit-learn. This project includes a script capable of loading data, preprocessing it, training multiple regression models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), tuning their hyperparameters, evaluating their performance, and identifying the best-performing model.

### Objectives
- To provide a hands-on example of machine learning model training and evaluation.
- To demonstrate hyperparameter tuning and model comparison techniques.
- To learn and apply best practices in machine learning with scikit-learn.

### What I Learned
- Implementing various regression models in scikit-learn.
- Custom and grid search-based hyperparameter tuning.
- Saving and loading machine learning models with joblib.
- Writing modular and reusable code for machine learning tasks.

## Installation
To set up this project, you need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib

Install the required packages using pip:
